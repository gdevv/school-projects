## About

### Overview
For one of our assignments in Cross-Platform Development, we were tasked with using an npm package called `socket.io` to create a web-based chat application whereby users (clients) can communicate with other users (clients) with the messages being managed by a central location (server).

### Requirements
* Display the number of currently connected clients. 
* As clients connect or disconnect to the server, inform all clients of a change in the number of clients connected.
* Modify the client such that a connection doesn't immediately occur, connection should instead happen when a `Connect` button is clicked on the UI.
* Modify the client such that the client is disconneced programatically without closing the client tab or window. Disconnection should happen when a `Disconnect` button is clicked on the UI.
* Add some UI functionality that will prevent the user from acting on the UI depending on whether the client is currently connected or not.

## Installation

```
npm install
```
