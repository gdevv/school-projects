## About

### Overview

For our final assignment in Software Development, we were tasked with creating a program in JavaScript that replicates the functionality of the game Battleship.

### Requirements

* On application start, ensure your code reads the contents of the provided ship grid
  into a two-dimensional array.
* Zeros (0) indicate empty water, while (1) indicates part of a ship exists at that location.
* Ensure that the ship map remains invisible to the user during game-play.
* Create a second map (the targeting map) to be displayed to the user each turn,
  and will be used to show the targeting results of the current game turn by turn.
* Ensure the initial display of the targeting map will be blank except for the row and column indicators (Columns A, B, C, Rows 1, 2, 3, etc.).
* Allow the user to have 30 turns to sink all of the ships.
* Prompt the user to enter a map coordinate (ex. A2, F5, B10) representing the missile location.
* Notify the user whether their attempt was a hit or miss.
* Update the targeting map to show the latest missile result.
* Display a message indicating the current missile count.
* Ensure only valid targeting coordinates are entered.

## Installation
