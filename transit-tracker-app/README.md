## About

### Overview
For our final assignment in Front-End Development, we were tasked with using Leaflet.js - a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps - to fetch and display real-time bus-data through [Halifax Transit open data](https://www.halifax.ca/home/open-data/halifax-transit-open-data). 

### Requirements
* Display a map in the browser.
* Fetch real-time transit data information data from a publicly available API. 
* Filter the raw data to a subset with specific criteria.
* Convert the filtered API data into GeoJSON format.
* Plot markers on the map to display the current position of vehicles.
* Add functionality that will cause the map to auto refresh after a specified interval of time.

### Additional Functionality
* Custom Vehicle Icon ‚Äì Update your map to use one of the provided vehicle icons as markers or choose one of your own.
* Rotate Vehicle Icon ‚Äì Rotate each vehicle marker to visually indicate the direction that it is currently travelling.
* Marker popups ‚Äì Leverage a click event to fill a popup with some of the additional data provided by the API.
