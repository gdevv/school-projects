## About

### Overview

For our final assignment in Full-Stack Development, we were tasked with creating a React app of our choosing. I choose to create a note-taking app, as I'm constantly making lists and writing small notes to myself, so I thought it would be super practical!

### Requirements

* Set up a React project using create-react-app
* Create functional React components.
* Create class-based React components.
* Using props in components.
* Using the useState hook in functional components.
* Using the useEffect hook in functional components (our example was one-time retrieval of data from a RESTful API).
* Passing arrays via props and using map to display lists in components.
* Using json-server to provide a ready-made RESTful API.

## Installation

Install dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Run the react-app.

```
npm start
```
Run the json-server.

```
npx json-server --watch -p 3003 db.json
```
